# Calorie Expenditure Prediction with XGBoost and Optuna

A machine learning project for predicting calorie expenditure using XGBoost regression with hyperparameter optimization via Optuna.

## Overview

This project implements a predictive model for calorie expenditure based on various fitness and physiological features. The model uses XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) with Optuna for automated hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance.

## Features

- XGBoost regression model for calorie prediction
- Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Kaggle competition format
